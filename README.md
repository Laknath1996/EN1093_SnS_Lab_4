# EN1093 Signals and Systems Lab 4
This repository contains the resources requried for the EN1093 Signals and Systems lab class 4. Please follow the following instructions to access these resources.

## Tips
Be familiar with Google Colab and using GitHub before starting this lab. 

## Prerequisits
* A google account (a google drive with a substantial space available).
* A working internet connection.

## Instructions
* Make a folder called "EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX" in your google drive. (Skip this if you have this folder in your drive already)
* Inside "EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX" folder, make a folder called "Lab4". (i.e.EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Lab3)
* Open the "Clone_File.ipynb" that we created during the Introduction to Colab session.
* Connect to a run time in the newly created notebook.
* Mount the google drive by running the following code.

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
* Navigate to the "Lab4" folder using the following command. Note : replace "/path/to/EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Lab3" with the true path.
```
% cd /path/to/EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Lab3
```
* Clone this github repository to the current folder.
```
! git clone https://github.com/Laknath1996/EN1093_SnS_Lab_4.git
```
* Close the "Clone_File.ipynb" and open the colab file ("EN1060_lab04.ipynb") inside the newly cloned repository.

Looking forwards to seeing you at class! :)

## New Instructions for EN1060_Lab04_Cart_Pole_System.ipynb

* Make a new folder with the name "Cart_Pole_System" within the "EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX" folder. (i.e.EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Cart_Pole_System)
* Open the "Clone_File.ipynb" that we created during the Introduction to Colab session.
* Connect to a run time in the newly created notebook.
* Mount the google drive by running the following code.

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
* Navigate to the "Cart_Pole_System" folder using the following command. Note : replace "/path/to/EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Cart_Pole_System" with the true path.
```
% cd /path/to/EN1060_Signals_and_Systems_Labs_190XXX/Cart_Pole_System
```
* Clone this github repository to the current folder.
```
! git clone https://github.com/Laknath1996/EN1093_SnS_Lab_4.git
```
* Close the "Clone_File.ipynb" and open the "EN1060_Lab04_Cart_Pole_System.ipynb" inside the newly cloned repository.

* Read the description about the Cart Pole System well and understand the mathematical model of it. 

* Go through the codes to understand the implementation details and complete them. Upon completing, run them to observe the cell outputs.
